                <h2> The Hackathon 2025 Event </h2>
                <p> The Climate Action Hackathon 2025 Urban Heat & Flood Resilience is a thematic innovation event
focused on addressing the growing climate challenges in urban areas, especially rising temperatures
and frequent flash floods.
The hackathon brings together students, developers, designers, and community innovators to cocreate digital solutions that support SDG 13: Climate Action. Participants will work in teams to build
prototypes, apps, or visualization tools that help communities: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Mitigate urban heat through green infrastructure mapping, smart shading, or cooling
strategies. </li>
                    <li> Improve flood resilience by creating early-warning systems, community response tools, or
interactive dashboards. </li>
                    <li> Raise climate risk awareness using data visualization, storytelling, or geospatial tools.
